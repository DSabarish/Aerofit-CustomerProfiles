# **Aerofit - Descriptive Statistics & Probability Analysis**

### Situation
Aerofit, a prominent brand in the fitness equipment industry, offers a range of treadmills to a diverse customer base. The company needed a comprehensive analysis to identify customer profiles and understand the target audience for each treadmill model (KP281, KP481, and KP781). This was critical for enhancing targeted marketing strategies, optimizing product positioning, and increasing overall market share.

### Task
The objective was to perform an in-depth analysis of customer data to:
1. Create detailed customer profiles for each treadmill model.
2. Conduct probability analysis to uncover insights related to product preferences across different demographics.
3. Generate actionable recommendations for the marketing and product development teams based on the findings.

### Action
1. **Data Analysis and Preparation**:
   - Loaded and preprocessed the dataset comprising 179 customers who purchased treadmills.
   - Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to detect and handle outliers, ensuring data quality and consistency.
   - Created new categorical features (e.g., Age Groups, Education Level, Fitness Level) for nuanced customer segmentation.

2. **Descriptive Analytics**:
   - Utilized descriptive statistics to profile customers based on demographic and behavioral attributes, highlighting key differences across product preferences.
   - Developed visualizations (e.g., histograms, box plots, correlation matrices) to identify trends and patterns.

3. **Probability Analysis**:
   - Constructed contingency tables and calculated marginal and conditional probabilities to understand customer behavior and product affinity.
   - Implemented hypothesis testing to validate the relationship between demographic factors (e.g., Gender, Fitness Level) and treadmill preferences.

4. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - Built a predictive model to recommend the most suitable treadmill for each customer segment, achieving an accuracy rate of 88.83%.
   - Integrated the model with cross-tabulated results, enabling precise product recommendations and enhancing decision-making for targeted marketing.

### Result
The project successfully delivered a robust analytical framework that provided Aerofit with:
- **Customer Segmentation**: Detailed profiles based on age, income, fitness level, and education, enabling more effective targeting.
- **Actionable Insights**: Key findings informed the marketing strategy, such as focusing KP281 promotions on young adults and tailoring KP781 campaigns towards high-income, high-fitness customers.
- **Strategic Recommendations**: Identified opportunities for product development and marketing, including partnerships with fitness influencers and the creation of high-end product variants for affluent customers.
- **Predictive Accuracy**: The predictive model accurately anticipated customer preferences for 88.83% of the cases, enhancing the precision of Aerofit’s marketing efforts.

The insights and recommendations from this project are set to drive significant improvements in Aerofit’s customer engagement, product positioning, and sales performance.
